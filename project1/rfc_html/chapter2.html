<H1>2. The IRC Specification</H1>

<A NAME="c2_1"></A>
<H2>2.1 Overview</H2>

   <P>The protocol as described herein is for use both with server to
   server and client to server connections.  There are, however, more
   restrictions on client connections (which are considered to be
   untrustworthy) than on server connections.</P>

<A NAME="c2_2"></A>
<H2>2.2 Character codes</H2>

   <P>No specific character set is specified. The protocol is based on a a
   set of codes which are composed of eight (8) bits, making up an
   octet.  Each message may be composed of any number of these octets;
   however, some octet values are used for control codes which act as
   message delimiters.</P>

   <P>Regardless of being an 8-bit protocol, the delimiters and keywords
   are such that protocol is mostly usable from USASCII terminal and a
   telnet connection.</P>

   <P>Because of IRC's scandanavian origin, the characters {}| are
   considered to be the lower case equivalents of the characters []\,
   respectively. This is a critical issue when determining the
   equivalence of two nicknames.</P>

<A NAME="c2_3"></A>
<H2>2.3 Messages</H2>

   <P>Servers and clients send eachother messages which may or may not
   generate a reply.  If the message contains a valid command, as
   described in later sections, the client should expect a reply as
   specified but it is not advised to wait forever for the reply; client
   to server and server to server communication is essentially
   asynchronous in nature.</P>

   <P>Each IRC message may consist of up to three main parts: the prefix
   (optional), the command, and the command parameters (of which there
   may be up to 15).  The prefix, command, and all parameters are
   separated by one (or more) ASCII space character(s) (0x20).</P>

   <P>The presence of a prefix is indicated with a single leading ASCII
   colon character (':', 0x3b), which must be the first character of the
   message itself.  There must be no gap (whitespace) between the colon
   and the prefix.  The prefix is used by servers to indicate the true
   origin of the message.  If the prefix is missing from the message, it
   is assumed to have originated from the connection from which it was
   received.  Clients should not use prefix when sending a message from
   themselves; if they use a prefix, the only valid prefix is the
   registered nickname associated with the client.  If the source
   identified by the prefix cannot be found from the server's internal
   database, or if the source is registered from a different link than
   from which the message arrived, the server must ignore the message
   silently.</P>

   <P>The command must either be a valid IRC command or a three (3) digit
   number represented in ASCII text.</P>

   <P>IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
   (Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages shall not
   exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
   the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
   for the command and its parameters.  There is no provision for
   continuation message lines.  See <a href="chapter8.html#c8">Section
   8</a> for more details about current implementations.</P>

    <p><i>15-441 Note: Your server must handle message termination as
    specified in <a href="chapter8.html#c8">Section 8</a> (recognition 
   that any LF or CR anywhere in a message marks the end of that message, 
   instead of requiring CR-LF).</i></p>
<A NAME="c2_3_1"></A>
<H3>2.3.1 Message format in 'pseudo' BNF</H3>

   <P>The protocol messages must be extracted from the contiguous stream of
   octets.  The current solution is to designate two characters, CR and
   LF, as message separators.   Empty  messages  are  silently  ignored,
   which permits  use  of  the  sequence  CR-LF  between  messages
   without extra problems.</P>

   <P>The extracted message is parsed into the components &lt;prefix&gt;,
   &lt;command&gt; and list of parameters matched either by &lt;middle&gt; or
   &lt;trailing&gt; components.</P>

   <P>The BNF representation for this is:</P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&lt;message&gt;  ::=</DT> <DD>[':' &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;SPACE&gt; ] &lt;command&gt; &lt;params&gt; &lt;crlf&gt;</DD>
<DT>&lt;prefix&gt;   ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;servername&gt; | &lt;nick&gt; | &lt;extended prefix&gt;</DD>
<DT>&lt;extended prefix&gt; ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;nick&gt;'!'&lt;user&gt;'@'&lt;host&gt;</DD>
<DT>&lt;command&gt;  ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;letter&gt; { &lt;letter&gt; } | &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt;</DD>
<DT>&lt;SPACE&gt;    ::=</DT> <DD>' ' { ' ' }</DD>
<DT>&lt;params&gt;   ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;SPACE&gt; [ ':' &lt;trailing&gt; | &lt;middle&gt; &lt;params&gt; ]</DD>

<DT>&lt;middle&gt;   ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;Any *non-empty* sequence of octets not including SPACE or NUL or CR or LF, the first of which may not be ':'&gt;</DD>
<DT>&lt;trailing&gt; ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;Any, possibly *empty*, sequence of octets not including  NUL or CR or LF&gt;</DD>

<DT>&lt;crlf&gt;     ::=</DT> <DD>CR LF</DD>
</DL>

<P>NOTES:</P>

  <OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
  <LI>  &lt;SPACE&gt; is consists only of SPACE character(s) (0x20).
        Specially notice that TABULATION, and all other control
        characters are considered NON-WHITE-SPACE.</LI>

  <LI>  After extracting the parameter list, all parameters are equal,
        whether matched by &lt;middle&gt; or &lt;trailing&gt;. &lt;Trailing&gt; is just
        a syntactic trick to allow SPACE within parameter.</LI>

  <LI>  The fact that CR and LF cannot appear in parameter strings is
        just artifact of the message framing. This might change later.</LI>

  <LI>  The NUL character is not special in message framing, and
        basically could end up inside a parameter, but as it would
        cause extra complexities in normal C string handling. Therefore
        NUL is not allowed within messages.</LI>

  <LI>  The last parameter may be an empty string.</LI>

  <LI>  The extended prefix (['!' &lt;user&gt; ] ['@' &lt;host&gt; ]) must
        not be used in server to server communications. However, it
        must be used for server to client messages.</LI>
  </OL>

   <P>Most protocol messages specify additional semantics and syntax for
   the extracted parameter strings dictated by their position in the
   list.  For example, many server commands will assume that the first
   parameter after the command is the list of targets, which can be
   described with:</P>

   <DL COMPACT>
   <DT>&lt;target&gt;     ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;to&gt; [ "," &lt;target&gt; ]</DD>
   <DT>&lt;to&gt;         ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;channel&gt; | &lt;user&gt; '@' &lt;servername&gt; | &lt;nick&gt; | &lt;mask&gt;</DD>
   <DT>&lt;channel&gt;    ::=</DT> <DD>('#' | '&') &lt;chstring&gt;</DD>
   <DT>&lt;servername&gt; ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;host&gt;</DD>
   <DT>&lt;host&gt;       ::=</DT> <DD>see RFC 952 [DNS:4] for details on allowed hostnames</DD>
   <DT>&lt;nick&gt;       ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;letter&gt; { &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;number&gt; | &lt;special&gt; }</DD>
   <DT>&lt;mask&gt;       ::=</DT> <DD>('#' | '$') &lt;chstring&gt;</DD>
   <DT>&lt;chstring&gt;   ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;any 8bit code except SPACE, BELL, NUL, CR, LF and comma (',')&gt;</DD>
   </DL>

   <P>Other parameter syntaxes are:</P>

   <DL COMPACT>
   <DT>&lt;user&gt;       ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;nonwhite&gt; { &lt;nonwhite&gt; }</DD>
   <DT>&lt;letter&gt;     ::=</DT> <DD>'a' ... 'z' | 'A' ... 'Z'</DD>
   <DT>&lt;number&gt;     ::=</DT> <DD>'0' ... '9'</DD>
   <DT>&lt;special&gt;    ::=</DT> <DD>'-' | '[' | ']' | '\' | '`' | '^' | '{' | '}'</DD>
   <DT>&lt;nonwhite&gt;   ::=</DT> <DD>&lt;any 8bit code except SPACE (0x20), NUL (0x0), CR (0xd), and LF (0xa)&gt;</DD>
   </DL>

<p><i>
15-441 Note: All targets will be nicks and channels. Masks and
user@servername will not be used in the project.
</i></p>

<H2>2.4 Numeric replies</H2>

   <P>Most of the messages sent to the server generate a reply of some
   sort.  The most common reply is the numeric reply, used for both
   errors and normal replies.  The numeric reply must be sent as one
   message consisting of the sender prefix, the three digit numeric,
   and the target of the reply.  In all other respects, a numeric
   reply is just like a normal message, except that the keyword is
   made up of 3 numeric digits rather than a string of letters.  A
   list of different replies is supplied in <A
   HREF="chapter6.html">section 6</A>.</P>

   <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>
    :irc-server.example.edu 421 nickname BOGUSCOMMAND :Unknown command
    </pre>

    <p><i>15-441 Note: For the sender prefix on messages originated by
    the server, you should use the hostname of the server, as returned
    by <code>gethostname()</code>. </i></p>
